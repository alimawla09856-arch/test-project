# AS Design Studio: AI Automation Suite & Client Onboarding Platform

A full-stack platform for [asdesignlb.com](https://asdesignlb.com). Prospective clients describe their project in an interactive **Project Builder** and watch a live estimate take shape. An **AI scope & budget analysis** (Claude by default, OpenAI optional) drafts a proposal, a strategist reviews and approves it in the **agency dashboard**, and **n8n** handles the rest: client emails with the PDF, Telegram and WhatsApp alerts, and CRM sync.

## What's inside

| Surface | Route | Highlights |
|---|---|---|
| **Project Builder** | `/` | A six-step Framer Motion wizard: services → vision → scope → budget & timeline → contact → review. A **live blueprint** prices the project from the rate card as the client chooses. Drafts are saved to `localStorage`, with a honeypot and minimum-fill-time spam checks. The vision step includes a **voice recorder** (mic capture, live level visualizer) that transcribes with Whisper and drops the text straight into the brief — English and Arabic (Gulf/Lebanese) both work, auto-detected. |
| **Embeddable builder** | `/embed` + `/widget.js` | Inline or popup embed for asdesignlb.com, with auto-height, UTM forwarding and an `asd:lead-submitted` DOM event. |
| **Client proposal portal** | `/p/{token}` | A private, branded proposal page: scope by phase, Gantt timeline, investment and payment schedule. The client can download the PDF and **accept or decline online**. Views are tracked. |
| **Proposal PDF** | `/p/{token}/pdf`, `/api/v1/proposals/{id}/pdf` | An A4 PDF rendered server-side with the brand fonts (Fraunces / Hanken Grotesk). **Bilingual**: each section shows its Arabic translation (Cairo font) above the original English — translated once by Claude and cached on the proposal (`src/lib/ai/translate.ts`). Falls back to English-only if `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` isn't set. |
| **Agency dashboard** | `/admin` | KPIs, a "needs attention" queue, a **real-time activity feed** (Server-Sent Events), leads and proposals trackers, and the AI analysis view (fit score, budget fit, risks, discovery questions). A **proposal editor** covers line items, phases, discount, tax and payment schedule, plus **regenerate with instructions** and **approve & send**. Settings shows integration health, n8n connection tests, and an **auto-send** toggle (on by default — see below). |
| **n8n templates** | `n8n/workflows/*.json` | Five importable workflows: lead intake, AI analysis, PDF, dispatch & alerts, CRM sync. They are generated from the same prompt, rate card and schema as the app. |

Everything is optional. With **no configuration** the app runs end-to-end: a local JSON store, the rule-based estimator instead of AI, and a development admin login.

---

## Quick start (zero config)

```bash
npm install
npm run dev            # http://localhost:3000
```

1. Open `http://localhost:3000`, fill in the Project Builder and submit.
2. Open `http://localhost:3000/admin` and sign in with the **development** login shown on the login page (`demo@asdesignlb.com` / `studio-demo`, enabled only when no admin is configured and `NODE_ENV` is not `production`).
3. Your lead is already in **Needs review**, with a proposal drafted by the rule-based estimator. Edit it, click **Approve & send**, then open **Client view** to accept it as the client would.
4. **Settings → Load demo leads** fills the dashboard with five fictional leads at different stages.

To turn on real AI, add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to `.env.local` and restart. New briefs are then analysed by Claude (`claude-opus-5`).

```

**The lead state machine:** `new → analyzing → review → approved → sent → won | lost` (and `archived`). Every transition is written to `lead_events`. That table drives the activity feeds and is the cursor for the live stream.

**Auto-send (default: on).** By default a proposal skips the `review` stop and is approved + dispatched to the client the moment it's generated — no strategist click required. Turn this off in **Settings → Automation** to go back to manual "Approve & send" (the diagram above shows the manual path). Demo-seeded leads are never auto-sent, regardless of this setting.

**Who runs the AI?**

- `ANALYSIS_RUNNER=n8n` (the default when the n8n webhooks are configured): n8n workflow 02 calls Claude or OpenAI and posts the structured result to `POST /api/v1/proposals`.
- `ANALYSIS_RUNNER=app`: the app calls Claude or OpenAI itself inside `after()`. n8n still receives notifications if it is configured.
- If n8n is unreachable, the app falls back to running the analysis in-process. If the AI provider fails, it falls back to the rule-based estimator (`AI_FALLBACK_TO_HEURISTIC=true`). Either way the lead is never stuck, and the dashboard shows why a fallback happened.

**The AI request:**

- Model `claude-opus-5` with adaptive thinking (`effort: high`).
- Structured outputs (`output_config.format`, a JSON schema generated from the Zod schema by the Anthropic SDK), with streaming in-app.
- Server-side refusal fallbacks (`fallbacks: "default"`, beta `server-side-fallback-2026-07-01`).
- The system prompt contains the studio **rate card**, so prices are anchored on real rates. The brief sent to the model is **data-minimised**: no name, email or phone.
- The app **re-validates and normalises** every analysis: scores are clamped, money is rounded, phase references are repaired, and the recommended total is recomputed from line items. The dashboard, PDF and CRM can never disagree.

## Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`. Every variable is documented inline; the important ones are below.

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | Public URL of this app, e.g. `https://automation.asdesignlb.com`. Used in links, emails, PDFs and n8n payloads. **Build-time** (inlined). |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTACT_EMAIL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_BOOKING_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_CURRENCY` | Brand and contact details shown to clients. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_OWNER_NAME` | Principal/owner name used in the AI persona and PDF signature (default `Ali Mawla`). |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_WHATSAPP_NUMBER` | Digits only, international format (e.g. `9613123456`). Shows a 1-click WhatsApp kickoff button in the site header when set; hidden otherwise. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_PHONE_DISPLAY` | Human-formatted phone shown in the proposal PDF footer, e.g. `+961 3 123 456`. Falls back to `NEXT_PUBLIC_WHATSAPP_NUMBER` if unset. |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Also required for **voice-note transcription** (`POST /api/v1/transcribe`, Whisper) regardless of `AI_PROVIDER`. |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | **Required in production.** 32+ random chars: `openssl rand -base64 48`. |
| `ADMIN_EMAIL` + `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` | Dashboard login. Generate the hash with `npm run admin:hash -- "long password"`. Add more admins with `ADMIN_USERS=a@x.com:hash,b@x.com:hash`. |
| `SUPABASE_URL` + `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Enables the Supabase store (server-side only). Without them: a local JSON file in `LOCAL_DATA_DIR`. |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` (default `claude-opus-5`), `AI_EFFORT` | Claude analysis. `AI_PROVIDER=openai` + `OPENAI_API_KEY` + `OPENAI_MODEL` switch to OpenAI. |
| `N8N_WEBHOOK_BASE_URL` | e.g. `https://n8n.asdesignlb.com/webhook`. The app appends `asd-lead-intake`, `asd-ai-analysis`, `asd-proposal-dispatch` and `asd-crm-sync`. Override each with `N8N_WEBHOOK_*`. |
| `N8N_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | App → n8n. Sent as `Authorization: Bearer …`, plus an `X-ASD-Signature` HMAC. |
| `N8N_CALLBACK_SECRET` | n8n → app. n8n authenticates to `/api/v1/*` with `Authorization: Bearer …`. |
| `EMBED_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Sites allowed to iframe `/embed` (CSP `frame-ancestors`). |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | CORS allow-list for posting to `/api/v1/onboard` from your own forms. |
| `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` / `_TOKEN` | Shared rate limiting (recommended on serverless). Without them, limits are kept in memory per instance. |

---

## Supabase setup

1. Create a project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) (a region close to your clients, e.g. `eu-central-1`).
2. Apply the schema, using **either** method:
   - **Supabase CLI:** `supabase link --project-ref <ref> && supabase db push`
   - **SQL editor:** paste the contents of `supabase/migrations/20260925000000_init.sql` and run it.
3. Copy **Project URL** and the **service_role** key (Settings → API) into `SUPABASE_URL` / `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.

**Schema overview**

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `leads` | One row per brief. Nested JSONB (`contact`, `project`, `plan`, `estimate`, `meta`, `crm`), plus generated `contact_name`, `contact_email` and `company` for search. Status, fit score and estimated value are denormalised for the dashboard. |
| `analyses` | Versioned AI analyses per lead: provider, model, runner (`app`/`n8n`), full structured `result`, token `usage`, fallback reason. |
| `proposals` | Versioned proposals: line items, phases, discount, tax, payment schedule, computed `totals` (+ generated `total`), `share_token` for the client portal, and approval / sent / viewed / response timestamps. |
| `lead_events` | Append-only activity log (bigint identity). Feeds the dashboard's live stream. |
| `idempotency_keys` | Deduplicates n8n retries of `POST /api/v1/proposals` (`Idempotency-Key` header). |
| `crm_contacts` | *Optional* flat CRM table, target of n8n workflow 05's Supabase branch. |
| `storage.buckets/proposals` | *Optional* private bucket for PDFs archived by workflow 03. |

**Row Level Security** is enabled on every table with **no** policies for `anon` / `authenticated`, and privileges are revoked. Only the server, holding the service-role key, can read or write. Never expose the service-role key to the browser.

---

## n8n setup

n8n runs the automation layer. Use n8n Cloud or self-host it (see `docker-compose.yml`). The templates are verified by import and live execution on **n8n 2.40** (they also target 1.x) and use only built-in nodes: Webhook, Respond to Webhook, Set, Code, IF, Switch, HTTP Request, Telegram, Send Email, Convert to File.

### 1. Create the credentials first

Create these credentials in n8n with **exactly these names** before importing, and the workflows bind to them automatically. Otherwise, select them on each node after import.

| Credential name | Type | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `ASD · Webhook auth (app → n8n)` | Header Auth | Name `Authorization`, Value `Bearer <N8N_WEBHOOK_SECRET>` |
| `ASD · App API (n8n → app)` | Header Auth | Name `Authorization`, Value `Bearer <N8N_CALLBACK_SECRET>` |
| `ASD · Anthropic API key` | Header Auth | Name `x-api-key`, Value `sk-ant-…` |
| `ASD · OpenAI API key` *(optional)* | Header Auth | Name `Authorization`, Value `Bearer sk-…` |
| `ASD · Telegram bot` | Telegram API | Bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) |
| `ASD · SMTP` | SMTP | Any SMTP provider (Google Workspace, Resend, Postmark, Brevo…) |
| `ASD · WhatsApp Cloud API token` *(optional)* | Header Auth | Name `Authorization`, Value `Bearer <Meta system-user token>` |
| `ASD · Airtable` *(optional)* | Airtable Personal Access Token | scopes `data.records:read/write` on the base |
| `ASD · Notion` *(optional)* | Notion API | internal integration shared with the database |
| `ASD · Supabase CRM` *(optional)* | Supabase API | host + service-role key of the CRM project |

### 2. Import the workflows

**Workflows → Import from file**, one per file in `n8n/workflows/`:

| File | Webhook path | Triggered by | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `01-lead-intake.json` | `asd-lead-intake` | `lead.created` | Telegram (and optional WhatsApp) alert for the team, an **admin email** (`adminEmail` in Config), and an acknowledgement email to the client. **Second entry point** `asd-external-lead` imports leads from Typeform, Webflow, Meta Lead Ads and similar into `POST /api/v1/onboard`. |
| `02-ai-scope-analysis.json` | `asd-ai-analysis` | `analysis.requested` | Builds the prompt (rate card, data-minimised brief, JSON schema), then calls **Claude** (default) or **OpenAI**, checks the stop reason and parses the result. Posts to `POST /api/v1/proposals` (idempotent), then sends a "draft ready" alert, or an `analysis.failed` event and a failure alert. |
| `03-proposal-pdf.json` | `asd-proposal-pdf` | workflow 04 | A PDF microservice. `pdfEngine=app` downloads the app-rendered PDF; `pdfEngine=gotenberg` renders branded HTML with Gotenberg. Can archive to Supabase Storage. |
| `04-client-dispatch-alerts.json` | `asd-proposal-dispatch` | `proposal.approved/accepted/declined/created` | On **approval**: fetches the PDF (via 03) and delivers it to the client by **email and/or WhatsApp** per their chosen `deliveryChannel` (set in the Contact step), reports `proposal.sent` per channel, and alerts the team (Telegram/WhatsApp + **admin email**). On **acceptance**: 🎉 alert (+ admin email) and welcome email. Declines alert the team (+ admin email) too. |
| `05-crm-sync.json` | `asd-crm-sync` | `crm.sync` (every change) | Upserts one record per lead, keyed on **Reference**, into Airtable, Notion and/or Supabase, and reports the record ids back. |

### 3. Configure & activate

Open the **⚙️ Config** node in each workflow and set `appBaseUrl` and `telegramChatId`, plus the email sender and the toggles you want (WhatsApp, Airtable, Notion, Supabase). Then **activate** all five workflows. Only production webhook URLs (`/webhook/…`) are called.

Finally, set in the app:

```
N8N_WEBHOOK_BASE_URL=https://n8n.asdesignlb.com/webhook
N8N_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<same secret as the "Webhook auth" credential>
N8N_CALLBACK_SECRET=<same secret as the "App API" credential>
```

**Admin → Settings → n8n workflows → Test** sends a `test.ping` to each workflow and reports the HTTP status.

**Finding your Telegram chat id:** add the bot to a group (or message it), then open `https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getUpdates` and copy `chat.id`.

**WhatsApp:** Meta's Cloud API only delivers free-form text to numbers that messaged your business number in the last 24 hours. For always-on team alerts (`WhatsApp · Sent`, `WhatsApp · Accepted`), create an approved **template** and switch those node bodies to `type: "template"`.

**WhatsApp to clients:** workflow 04's `Send Client WhatsApp` node already sends `type: "template"` (a client almost never messaged you first). Before enabling `whatsappEnabled`, create and get approved a Meta message template whose body takes three variables — e.g. "Hi {{1}}, your proposal is ready — {{2}}. Review and accept: {{3}}" — and set its exact name in the `whatsappClientTemplateName` Config field. A client is only offered the WhatsApp/Both delivery option in the Project Builder if they marked their phone number as WhatsApp-enabled.

### CRM field mapping

Airtable table `Leads` (create these fields; `typecast` creates select options automatically):
`Reference` (primary, single line) · `Name` · `Email` (email) · `Phone` · `Company` · `Status` (single select) · `Services` (single line) · `Budget` · `Timeline` · `Source` · `Fit Score` (number) · `Estimated Value` (currency) · `Proposal Status` · `Proposal Total` (currency) · `Last Event` · `Created` (date) · `Dashboard` (URL) · `Proposal` (URL)

Notion database properties:
`Name` (title) · `Reference` (text) · `Email` (email) · `Phone` (phone) · `Company` (text) · `Status` (select) · `Services` (multi-select) · `Budget` (text) · `Timeline` (text) · `Fit Score` (number) · `Estimated Value` (number) · `Proposal Total` (number) · `Created` (date) · `Dashboard` (URL) · `Proposal` (URL)

### Regenerating the templates

The AI workflow embeds the system prompt, rate card and JSON schema from `src/`. After you edit `src/config/catalog.ts`, `src/lib/ai/prompt.ts` or `src/lib/schemas/analysis.ts`:

```bash
npm run n8n:build     # rewrites n8n/workflows/*.json — then re-import workflow 02
npm run n8n:check     # CI guard: fails if the committed JSON is stale
```

## Embedding on asdesignlb.com

**Option A: inline builder**

```html
<div id="asd-project-builder"></div>
<script src="https://automation.asdesignlb.com/widget.js" data-target="#asd-project-builder" async></script>
```

**Option B: floating "Start a project" button with a modal**

```html
<script src="https://automation.asdesignlb.com/widget.js" data-mode="popup" data-label="Start a project" async></script>
<!-- open it from any element -->
<a href="#" data-asd-open>Get a proposal</a>
```

Options: `data-background="transparent"`, `data-position="left"`, `data-accent="#ff8a4c"`, `data-launcher="false"` (popup without the floating button). JS API: `window.ASDBuilder.open()` / `.close()`.

Analytics hook: `window.addEventListener("asd:lead-submitted", e => gtag("event", "generate_lead", { reference: e.detail.reference }))`.

The loader forwards the host page's `utm_*` parameters and URL, so attribution lands on the lead. Add the parent domains to `EMBED_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.

**Option C: subdomain.** Host the platform at `automation.asdesignlb.com` (or `start.asdesignlb.com`) and link to it from the main navigation. Point a `CNAME` at your host (Vercel: `cname.vercel-dns.com`) and set `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`.

**WordPress / Webflow / Framer:** paste snippet A into an HTML / Embed block, or add snippet B to the site-wide footer code.

---

## Deployment

### Vercel (recommended with Supabase)

1. Import the repo into Vercel. The framework preset is detected.
2. Add the environment variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_*` must be present at **build** time).
3. Add the domain `automation.asdesignlb.com`.
4. Use **Supabase** as the store (the local JSON store is not persistent on serverless), and **Upstash** for shared rate limiting.
5. Keep the default analysis runner (`n8n`), or with `ANALYSIS_RUNNER=app` make sure your plan allows ~300 s functions (`maxDuration` is set on the routes that may run the AI).

### Docker / VPS (self-hosted, with n8n + Gotenberg)

```bash
cp .env.example .env      # set secrets, N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY, public URLs
docker compose up -d --build
# app → :3000, n8n → :5678 (put Caddy / Traefik / Nginx with TLS in front)
```

The image is the Next.js **standalone** build (`NEXT_OUTPUT=standalone`) and runs as a non-root user, with a health check on `/api/v1/health`. On a single server you can run without Supabase: the `app-data` volume persists the local store. Supabase is still recommended for backups and multi-instance setups.

### Production checklist

- [ ] `SESSION_SECRET`, `ADMIN_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` set; dev login disabled (automatic in production)
- [ ] Supabase migration applied; service-role key only in server env
- [ ] `N8N_WEBHOOK_SECRET` / `N8N_CALLBACK_SECRET` set in both the app and the n8n credentials; all five workflows active
- [ ] `EMBED_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` / `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` list only your domains
- [ ] SMTP sender domain has SPF, DKIM and DMARC records
- [ ] Rate card in `src/config/catalog.ts` reflects real pricing → `npm run n8n:build` → re-import workflow 02
- [ ] Privacy policy on asdesignlb.com mentions AI-assisted proposal preparation

| Services, price ranges, durations, deliverables, feature add-ons, budgets, timelines, payment schedule, bundle discounts | `src/config/catalog.ts` (**single source of truth**, also injected into the AI prompt) |
| AI system prompt & user message | `src/lib/ai/prompt.ts` |
| Structured output contract | `src/lib/schemas/analysis.ts` |
| Rule-based estimator (no-AI mode & fallback) | `src/lib/ai/heuristic.ts` |
| Brand name, principal/owner name (AI persona + PDF signature), monogram, WhatsApp kickoff number, phone shown in the PDF footer, colours for the PDF, contact details | `src/config/brand.ts` + `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars (`NEXT_PUBLIC_OWNER_NAME`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_WHATSAPP_NUMBER`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_PHONE_DISPLAY`) |
| Design tokens (colours, fonts, glass utilities) | `src/app/globals.css` (Tailwind v4 `@theme`) |
| Proposal PDF layout | `src/lib/pdf/ProposalDocument.tsx` |
| Email templates | Code nodes in n8n workflows 01 and 04 (`n8n/src/snippets.ts` for the shared layout) |

> Prices in `catalog.ts` are calibrated to AS Design's real, published rate card on asdesignlb.com/pricing. Re-sync them by hand if the published rates change — nothing here reads that page live.

## Security notes

- **Auth:** the admin session is an HS256 JWT in an `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax` cookie (7 days). Passwords are hashed with scrypt, and login is rate-limited with uniform timing for unknown emails. `proxy.ts` does an optimistic check on `/admin`; every page and API handler re-verifies. Admin mutations reject cross-origin requests.
- **Webhooks:** bearer secrets are compared in constant time. Outbound requests carry an HMAC signature with a timestamp. Callbacks are idempotent.
- **Client portal:** 256-bit share tokens. Drafts are never exposed (404), links expire with `validUntil`, pages are `noindex`, and responses are rate-limited.
- **Data minimisation:** AI providers never receive client names, emails or phone numbers. IPs are stored only as salted hashes. `DELETE /api/v1/leads/{id}` erases a lead (GDPR / Lebanese Law 81/2018 requests).
- **Headers:** `nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`, HSTS, `frame-ancestors` (only `/embed` can be framed, and only by allowed origins), and `no-store` on the API.
- **Spam:** a honeypot field, a minimum fill time, per-IP rate limits and Zod validation with payload size limits.
